Trading Server for Advanced Orders
==================================

This server is what is used by the CryptoControl Terminal to execute advanced orders like stop-losses, trailing stop-losses, take profit and more.

This codebase is open-sourced so that anybody can host the trading server on their own and keep their API key off from CryptoControl.
