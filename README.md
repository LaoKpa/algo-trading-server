Trading Server for Advanced Orders
==================================

This server is what is used by the CryptoControl Terminal to execute advanced orders like stop-losses, trailing stop-losses, take profit and more.

The server is open-sourced so that anybody can host the trading server on their own and keep their API key off from CryptoControl. The trading server can also be easily hosted via docker.

For a quick start with docker-compose run,
```
docker-compose up
```
